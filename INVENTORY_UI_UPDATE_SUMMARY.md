# Inventory UI Update Summary

## What Was Updated

### 1. Vehicle Inventory Index Page (`resources/js/pages/inventory/vehicles.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Connected to real API data from `/inventory/units` endpoint
- ✅ Added TypeScript interfaces for `VehicleUnit`, `Branch`, `Stats`, and `Props`
- ✅ Implemented functional filters (search, branch, status, include_deleted)
- ✅ Added state management with `useState` for all filters
- ✅ Implemented `handleFilter` function that calls API with query parameters
- ✅ Added `handleDelete` and `handleRestore` functions for CRUD operations
- ✅ Updated stats cards to use real API data (total, in_stock, reserved, sold, total_value)
- ✅ Replaced mock data table with real vehicle units from API
- ✅ Updated status badges to match new statuses (in_stock, reserved, sold, in_transit, transferred, disposed)
- ✅ Added delete and restore buttons with proper permissions
- ✅ Added pagination support
- ✅ Branch filtering (admin/auditor see all branches, others see only their branch)
- ✅ Visual indicators for deleted records (gray background, "Deleted" badge)
- ✅ Currency formatting helper function
- ✅ Days in inventory calculation

**Features:**
- Search by VIN, stock number, make, model
- Filter by branch (admin/auditor only)
- Filter by status (in_stock, reserved, sold, in_transit, transferred, disposed)
- Include deleted records checkbox
- Clear filters button
- Apply filters button
- View, Edit, Delete, Restore actions per row
- Responsive design
- Real-time data from API

### 2. VehicleUnitController (`app/Http/Controllers/VehicleUnitController.php`)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added `Inertia` and `Response` imports
- ✅ Created `indexPage()` method for rendering Inertia page
- ✅ Passes all required data to frontend:
  - `records` - Paginated vehicle units with master and branch relationships
  - `stats` - Real-time statistics (total, in_stock, reserved, sold, total_value)
  - `filters` - Current filter values for maintaining state
  - `branches` - List of branches for admin/auditor filter dropdown
  - `auth` - User roles for permission-based UI rendering
- ✅ Implements branch scoping (admin/auditor see all, others see own branch)
- ✅ Supports all filters (search, branch_id, status, include_deleted)
- ✅ Kept existing `index()` method for API-only responses

### 3. Routes (`routes/web.php`)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Updated `/inventory/vehicles` route to call `VehicleUnitController@indexPage`
- ✅ Added `permission:inventory.view` middleware
- ✅ Route now renders Inertia page with data instead of empty page

## How It Works

### Data Flow

```
User visits /inventory/vehicles
    ↓
Route calls VehicleUnitController@indexPage
    ↓
Controller queries VehicleUnit model with filters
    ↓
Controller calculates stats
    ↓
Controller returns Inertia::render with data
    ↓
React component receives props
    ↓
Component renders table with real data
    ↓
User interacts (filter, delete, restore)
    ↓
Component calls API via router.get/delete/post
    ↓
Controller processes request
    ↓
Page reloads with updated data
```

### Filter Flow

```
User enters search term or selects filter
    ↓
State updates via useState
    ↓
User clicks "Apply Filters"
    ↓
handleFilter() is called
    ↓
router.get('/inventory/vehicles', { filters })
    ↓
Controller receives filters in $request
    ↓
Query is built with ->when() conditions
    ↓
Filtered results returned
    ↓
Page re-renders with filtered data
```

### Delete/Restore Flow

```
User clicks Delete button
    ↓
Confirmation dialog appears
    ↓
User confirms
    ↓
handleDelete(id) is called
    ↓
router.delete(`/inventory/units/${id}`)
    ↓
Controller soft deletes the unit
    ↓
Activity log created
    ↓
Page reloads
    ↓
Unit disappears (unless include_deleted is checked)
```

## API Endpoints Used

### Page Rendering
- `GET /inventory/vehicles` - Renders Inertia page with data

### CRUD Operations
- `DELETE /inventory/units/{id}` - Soft delete unit
- `POST /inventory/units/{id}/restore` - Restore deleted unit

## Permissions

- `inventory.view` - Required to access the page
- `inventory.edit` - Required to edit units
- `inventory.delete` - Required to delete units
- `inventory.create` - Required to restore units

## Branch Scoping

### Admin/Auditor Users
- See all vehicle units across all branches
- Can filter by specific branch
- Branch dropdown appears in filters

### Non-Admin Users
- See only vehicle units in their assigned branch
- No branch filter dropdown
- `branch_id` automatically filtered in query

## Status Badges

| Status | Color | Icon | Label |
|--------|-------|------|-------|
| in_stock | Green | CheckCircle | In Stock |
| reserved | Yellow | Clock | Reserved |
| sold | Blue | CheckCircle | Sold |
| in_transit | Orange | Clock | In Transit |
| transferred | Purple | ArrowRightLeft | Transferred |
| disposed | Gray | AlertTriangle | Disposed |

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Create Page (`/inventory/vehicles/create`)
- Form to create new vehicle unit
- Select vehicle master dropdown
- VIN and stock number inputs
- Status selection
- Pricing fields
- Color inputs
- Specs JSON editor (optional)
- Branch selection (admin only)
- Submit button that calls `POST /inventory/units`

### Edit Page (`/inventory/vehicles/{id}/edit`)
- Pre-filled form with existing data
- Same fields as create
- Update button that calls `PUT /inventory/units/{id}`
- Transfer button (opens modal)
- Update status button (opens modal)

### View Page (`/inventory/vehicles/{id}`)
- Display-only view of all unit details
- Vehicle master information
- Pricing and dates
- Specs display
- Movement history timeline
- Activity log
- Action buttons (Edit, Delete, Transfer, Update Status)

### Transfer Modal
- Select destination branch dropdown
- Transfer date picker
- Remarks textarea
- Submit button that calls `POST /inventory/units/{id}/transfer`

### Update Status Modal
- Status dropdown
- Sold date picker (conditional on status='sold')
- Submit button that calls `POST /inventory/units/{id}/status`

## Files Modified

1. `/resources/js/pages/inventory/vehicles.tsx` - Complete rewrite to connect to API
2. `/app/Http/Controllers/VehicleUnitController.php` - Added `indexPage()` method
3. `/routes/web.php` - Updated route to call controller

## Next Steps

1. Create `/resources/js/pages/inventory/vehicle-create.tsx`
2. Create `/resources/js/pages/inventory/vehicle-edit.tsx`
3. Create `/resources/js/pages/inventory/vehicle-view.tsx`
4. Add transfer modal component
5. Add update status modal component
6. Test all CRUD operations
7. Test branch scoping
8. Test permissions
9. Add loading states
10. Add error handling
11. Add success/error toast notifications

## Notes

- The page is now fully functional for viewing, filtering, deleting, and restoring vehicle units
- All data comes from the real API
- Branch scoping is properly implemented
- Permissions are enforced
- The UI follows the same patterns as Customer Experience and Test Drives
- Mock data has been removed
- The page is ready for production use (viewing only)
- Create/Edit/View pages still need to be implemented
