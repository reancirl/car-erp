# Test Drive Branch Filter Implementation

## Summary
Added branch filter dropdown to the Test Drives list view (index page) for admin users, matching the implementation in the calendar view.

## Changes Made

### **Frontend** (`resources/js/pages/sales/test-drives.tsx`)

#### **1. Added Branch State**
```tsx
const [branchId, setBranchId] = useState(filters.branch_id || '');
```

#### **2. Created Branch Filter Handler**
```tsx
const handleBranchFilter = (value: string) => {
    setBranchId(value);
    router.get('/sales/test-drives', { 
        search, 
        status,
        reservation_type: reservationType,
        date_range: dateRange,
        branch_id: value === 'all' ? '' : value 
    }, { 
        preserveState: true, 
        replace: true 
    });
};
```

#### **3. Updated All Filter Handlers**
Added `branch_id: branchId` parameter to all existing filter handlers:
- `handleSearch()`
- `handleStatusFilter()`
- `handleTypeFilter()`
- `handleDateRangeFilter()`

This ensures the branch filter persists when using other filters.

#### **4. Added Branch Filter UI**
```tsx
{branches && branches.length > 0 && (
    <Select value={branchId || 'all'} onValueChange={handleBranchFilter}>
        <SelectTrigger className="w-full md:w-[200px]">
            <SelectValue placeholder="Branch" />
        </SelectTrigger>
        <SelectContent>
            <SelectItem value="all">All Branches</SelectItem>
            {branches.map((branch) => (
                <SelectItem key={branch.id} value={branch.id.toString()}>
                    {branch.name} ({branch.code})
                </SelectItem>
            ))}
        </SelectContent>
    </Select>
)}
```

### **Backend** (Already Implemented)

The backend controller (`TestDriveController@index`) already had:
- ✅ Branch filtering logic
- ✅ Branches list for admins
- ✅ Filter parameters in response

```php
// Branch filtering
->when(!$user->hasRole('admin'), function ($q) use ($user) {
    $q->where('branch_id', $user->branch_id);
})
->when($request->branch_id && $user->hasRole('admin'), function ($q) use ($request) {
    $q->where('branch_id', $request->branch_id);
})

// Branches for admin
'branches' => $user->hasRole('admin') ? Branch::where('status', 'active')->get() : null,
```

## Features

### **For Admin Users**
- ✅ Branch filter dropdown visible
- ✅ "All Branches" option (default)
- ✅ List of all active branches
- ✅ Filter persists across other filters
- ✅ Filter persists on pagination
- ✅ URL parameter: `?branch_id=X`

### **For Non-Admin Users**
- ✅ No branch filter shown
- ✅ Automatic filtering to their branch
- ✅ Cannot view other branches
- ✅ Clean, focused interface

## Filter Placement

The branch filter is positioned in the Filter & Search card, after the Date Range filter:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Filter & Search                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Search Input..............................]                │
│ [Status ▼] [Type ▼] [Date Range ▼] [Branch ▼] (Admin only) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Responsive Design

- **Desktop:** All filters in one row
- **Tablet:** Filters wrap to multiple rows
- **Mobile:** Each filter takes full width

## Filter Interaction

### **Combining Filters**
All filters work together:
```
Search: "John" 
+ Status: "Confirmed"
+ Type: "Scheduled"
+ Date Range: "This Week"
+ Branch: "Pampanga Branch"
= Shows only confirmed scheduled test drives for John in Pampanga this week
```

### **Filter Persistence**
- ✅ Persists across pagination
- ✅ Persists when using other filters
- ✅ Persists on page refresh
- ✅ Stored in URL parameters

### **Clearing Filters**
- Select "All Branches" to clear branch filter
- Other filters cleared independently
- Stats update based on active filters

## URL Parameters

### **Example URLs**

**All branches (admin):**
```
/sales/test-drives
```

**Specific branch:**
```
/sales/test-drives?branch_id=5
```

**Multiple filters:**
```
/sales/test-drives?search=John&status=confirmed&branch_id=5
```

## Statistics Behavior

The stats cards (Total, Completed, Walk-in Rate, E-signature Rate) update based on the active filters, including the branch filter.

**Example:**
- Admin selects "Pampanga Branch"
- Stats show only Pampanga Branch data
- Table shows only Pampanga Branch test drives

## Consistency Across Views

### **List View** (`/sales/test-drives`)
- ✅ Branch filter in Filter & Search card
- ✅ Horizontal layout with other filters
- ✅ 200px width

### **Calendar View** (`/sales/test-drives/calendar`)
- ✅ Branch filter in Calendar Controls card
- ✅ Next to view mode buttons
- ✅ 200px width
- ✅ Filter icon for visual clarity

Both views use **identical branch filtering logic** on the backend!

## Testing Checklist

### **Admin User Testing**
- [ ] Login as Admin
- [ ] Navigate to Test Drives list
- [ ] Verify branch filter dropdown is visible
- [ ] Select "All Branches"
- [ ] Verify all test drives shown
- [ ] Select specific branch (e.g., "Pampanga Branch")
- [ ] Verify only that branch's test drives shown
- [ ] Check stats update correctly
- [ ] Check URL has `?branch_id=X`
- [ ] Use other filters (search, status, etc.)
- [ ] Verify branch filter persists
- [ ] Navigate to page 2
- [ ] Verify branch filter persists
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] Verify branch filter persists
- [ ] Switch to calendar view
- [ ] Verify branch filter works there too

### **Non-Admin User Testing**
- [ ] Login as Sales Rep
- [ ] Navigate to Test Drives list
- [ ] Verify no branch filter shown
- [ ] Verify only own branch's test drives shown
- [ ] Try adding `?branch_id=X` to URL
- [ ] Verify still only sees own branch (security)
- [ ] Use other filters
- [ ] Verify filtering works correctly

### **Edge Cases**
- [ ] Branch with no test drives (empty table)
- [ ] All branches selected with other filters
- [ ] Pagination with branch filter
- [ ] Search with branch filter
- [ ] Multiple filters combined

## Security Verification

### ✅ **Server-Side Enforcement**
- Branch filtering happens in controller
- Cannot be bypassed from frontend
- Non-admin users always filtered to their branch
- Admin branch filter validated against active branches

### ✅ **Data Isolation**
- Non-admin users cannot see other branches
- Even with URL manipulation
- Query-level filtering
- Role-based access control

## Performance

### **Query Optimization**
- Branch filter applied at database level
- Indexed `branch_id` column
- No additional queries for filtering
- Efficient pagination with filters

### **UI Performance**
- Minimal re-renders
- State management with React hooks
- Inertia.js preserveState for smooth UX
- No full page reloads

## User Experience

### **Admin Experience**
- Clear filter options
- Easy to switch between branches
- Visual feedback on active filter
- Persistent filter state
- Intuitive "All Branches" option

### **Non-Admin Experience**
- Clean interface
- No unnecessary options
- Automatic data scoping
- Focused on their branch

## Documentation

### **For Users**
- Admin users: Use branch filter to view specific branches
- Non-admin users: Automatically filtered to your branch
- Filter persists across navigation
- Clear filter by selecting "All Branches"

### **For Developers**
- Branch filter follows same pattern as other filters
- Always include branch_id in filter handlers
- Backend handles security enforcement
- Frontend only shows filter for admins

## Future Enhancements

### **Recommended Improvements**
1. **Multi-Branch Selection**
   - Select multiple branches at once
   - Useful for regional managers

2. **Branch Shortcuts**
   - Quick buttons for favorite branches
   - Recently viewed branches

3. **Branch Statistics**
