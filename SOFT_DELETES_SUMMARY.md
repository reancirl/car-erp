# Soft Deletes Implementation Summary

## âœ… What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Migrations
- âœ… Added `deleted_at` column to **branches** table
- âœ… Added `deleted_at` column to **users** table  
- âœ… **leads** table already had soft deletes

### 2. Models Updated
- âœ… `Branch` model - Added `SoftDeletes` trait
- âœ… `User` model - Added `SoftDeletes` trait
- âœ… `Lead` model - Already had `SoftDeletes` trait

### 3. Controllers Enhanced

#### BranchController
- âœ… `index()` - Added `include_deleted` filter support
- âœ… `destroy()` - Now performs soft delete
- âœ… `restore($id)` - New method to restore deleted branches
- âœ… Activity logging on delete and restore

#### UserController
- âœ… `index()` - Added `include_deleted` filter support
- âœ… `destroy()` - Now performs soft delete
- âœ… `restore($id)` - New method to restore deleted users
- âœ… Activity logging on delete and restore

#### LeadController
- âœ… `index()` - Added `include_deleted` filter support
- âœ… `destroy()` - Now performs soft delete
- âœ… `restore($id)` - New method to restore deleted leads
- âœ… Branch-scoped restore (users can only restore their branch's leads)
- âœ… Activity logging on delete and restore

### 4. Activity Logging

#### New Trait Method
```php
protected function logRestored(
    string $module,
    $subject,
    string $description,
    array $properties = []
): ActivityLog
```

#### New Log Actions
- `branch.restore` - Branch restoration logged
- `users.restore` - User restoration logged
- `sales.restore` - Lead restoration logged

### 5. Routes Added

```php
// Branch restore
POST /admin/branch-management/{id}/restore

// User restore (requires users.create permission)
POST /admin/user-management/{id}/restore

// Lead restore (requires sales.create permission)
POST /sales/lead-management/{id}/restore
```

### 6. Activity Log Modal Enhancement

**New Features:**
- âœ… Detects if the logged action's subject is soft deleted
- âœ… Shows "Restore Record" button if deleted
- âœ… Button appears in modal footer (left side)
- âœ… Green button with rotate icon
- âœ… Confirmation dialog before restore
- âœ… Automatically determines correct restore route based on module
- âœ… Reloads page after successful restore

**How It Works:**
```tsx
// In activity log modal
{selectedLog.subject_deleted && (
    <Button 
        variant="default" 
        onClick={() => handleRestore(selectedLog)}
        className="bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700"
    >
        <RotateCcw className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
        Restore Record
    </Button>
)}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ User Workflow

### Scenario 1: Accidental Delete â†’ Immediate Restore

1. User deletes a branch/user/lead
2. Realizes it was a mistake
3. Opens **Activity Logs** page
4. Finds the delete action in the logs
5. Clicks the **eye icon** to view details
6. Sees **"Restore Record"** button (green)
7. Clicks restore â†’ Confirms
8. Record is restored!
9. Activity log shows the restoration

### Scenario 2: View Deleted Records

1. Go to Branch/User/Lead management page
2. Enable "Include Deleted" filter
3. See deleted records (grayed out or marked)
4. Click restore button on the record
5. Record is restored

### Scenario 3: Audit Trail

1. Open Activity Logs
2. Filter by `delete` or `restore` actions
3. See complete history:
   - Who deleted it
   - When it was deleted
   - Who restored it
   - When it was restored
4. All with full property tracking

## ðŸ“Š Activity Log Data

### Delete Log Entry
```json
{
  "action": "branch.delete",
  "module": "Branch",
  "event": "deleted",
  "description": "Deleted branch Manila Branch (MNL)",
  "subject_type": "App\\Models\\Branch",
  "subject_id": 5,
  "subject_deleted": true,
  "properties": {
    "branch_code": "MNL",
    "city": "Manila",
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```

### Restore Log Entry
```json
{
  "action": "branch.restore",
  "module": "Branch",
  "event": "restored",
  "description": "Restored branch Manila Branch (MNL)",
  "subject_type": "App\\Models\\Branch",
  "subject_id": 5,
  "subject_deleted": false,
  "properties": {
    "branch_code": "MNL",
    "city": "Manila",
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```

## ðŸ”’ Security & Permissions

### Branch Restore
- âœ… No special permission required (managed by branch management access)
- âœ… Respects existing branch management permissions

### User Restore
- âœ… Requires `users.create` permission
- âœ… Only users with create permission can restore deleted users

### Lead Restore
- âœ… Requires `sales.create` permission
- âœ… **Branch-scoped**: Non-admin users can only restore leads from their branch
- âœ… Admins can restore leads from any branch

## ðŸ’¡ Key Benefits

1. **Data Recovery**: No more permanent data loss
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete deletion and restoration history
3. **User-Friendly**: Restore directly from activity logs
4. **Secure**: Permission-based restore operations
5. **Branch-Aware**: Maintains branch isolation for non-admin users
6. **Automatic Logging**: Every delete and restore is logged

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Optional)

Future enhancements you could add:

1. **Bulk Restore**: Restore multiple records at once
2. **Auto-Expire**: Permanently delete records after X days
3. **Restore Preview**: Show what will be restored before confirming
4. **Cascade Restore**: Restore related records together
5. **Restore Notifications**: Email notifications on restore
6. **Deleted Records Dashboard**: Dedicated page for managing deleted items

## âœ¨ Summary

Soft deletes are now fully implemented across Branch, User, and Lead modules with:
- âœ… Database support
- âœ… Model traits
- âœ… Controller methods
- âœ… Activity logging
- âœ… Restore routes
- âœ… UI integration in activity logs
- âœ… Permission checks
- âœ… Branch scoping

Everything is ready to use! Records can now be safely deleted and easily restored when needed. ðŸŽ‰
