## Summary

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

The user CRUD is complete and ready to use, following the exact same pattern as branch management. No additional coding needed. The UI automatically fetches real data from the database through the controller. All create, read, update, and delete operations work out of the box.

You can now:
- View all users with branch and role info
- Search and filter by name, email, branch, or role
- Create new users with branch and role assignments
- Edit existing users (including optional password updates)
- View user details
- Delete users (with confirmation)

The system integrates seamlessly with:
- **Spatie Laravel Permission** for role-based access control
- **Branch Management** for user-branch assignments
- **MFA System** (existing infrastructure)

The system is ready for production use!
