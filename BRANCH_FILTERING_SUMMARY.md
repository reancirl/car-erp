# Branch Filtering Implementation for Activity Logs

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `branch_id` column to `activity_logs` table
- Created foreign key relationship to `branches` table
- Added index for optimal query performance

### 2. Automatic Branch Capture
The `LogsActivity` trait now automatically captures the user's branch when logging activities:
```php
// In LogsActivity trait
if (Auth::check()) {
    $user = Auth::user();
    if ($user && isset($user->branch_id)) {
        $logData['branch_id'] = $user->branch_id;
    }
}
```

**Result**: Every activity log automatically records which branch the action was performed in.

### 3. Branch-Based Access Control

#### For Non-Admin Users:
- ‚úÖ Only see activity logs from their own branch
- ‚úÖ Statistics scoped to their branch
- ‚úÖ Filtering and search limited to their branch
- ‚úÖ Export only includes their branch's logs
- ‚úÖ No branch filter visible (automatic)

#### For Admin Users:
- ‚úÖ See all logs across all branches by default
- ‚úÖ Branch filter dropdown available
- ‚úÖ Can filter by specific branch
- ‚úÖ Statistics update based on selected branch
- ‚úÖ Export respects branch filter

### 4. Frontend Changes
**Activity Logs Page (`/audit/activity-logs`)**

**For Admin Users:**
```tsx
{branches && (
    <Select value={selectedBranch} onValueChange={setSelectedBranch}>
        <SelectItem value="all">All Branches</SelectItem>
        {branches.map((branch) => (
            <SelectItem value={branch.id.toString()}>
                {branch.name} ({branch.code})
            </SelectItem>
        ))}
    </Select>
)}
```

**For Non-Admin Users:**
- Branch filter not rendered
- All queries automatically scoped to user's branch

### 5. Backend Changes

**ActivityLogController:**
```php
// Branch filtering in index method
if (!$user->hasRole('admin')) {
    $query->where('branch_id', $user->branch_id);
} elseif ($request->filled('branch_id')) {
    $query->where('branch_id', $request->branch_id);
}
```

**Statistics Calculation:**
```php
// Statistics now branch-aware
private function getStatistics($user, $branchId = null)
{
    $baseQuery = ActivityLog::query();
    if (!$user->hasRole('admin')) {
        $baseQuery->where('branch_id', $user->branch_id);
    } elseif ($branchId) {
        $baseQuery->where('branch_id', $branchId);
    }
    // ... calculate stats using baseQuery
}
```

## üéØ Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Non-Admin User
1. Login as a sales_rep or branch manager
2. Navigate to `/audit/activity-logs`
3. **Expected**: Only see logs from their branch
4. Create/Update/Delete a record in any module
5. **Expected**: Log appears immediately in activity logs
6. **Expected**: No branch filter dropdown visible

### Test Case 2: Admin User - All Branches
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to `/audit/activity-logs`
3. **Expected**: See logs from all branches
4. **Expected**: Branch filter shows "All Branches" by default
5. Statistics show aggregate across all branches

### Test Case 3: Admin User - Specific Branch
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to `/audit/activity-logs`
3. Select a specific branch from dropdown
4. Click "Apply"
5. **Expected**: Only see logs from selected branch
6. **Expected**: Statistics update for that branch only
7. Click "Export Logs"
8. **Expected**: CSV contains only selected branch's logs

### Test Case 4: Branch Isolation
1. Create a user in Branch A
2. Create a lead/branch/user in Branch A
3. Login as user from Branch B
4. Navigate to activity logs
5. **Expected**: Cannot see Branch A's activities
6. **Expected**: Only see Branch B's activities

## üìä What Gets Logged with Branch

Every activity now includes:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "action": "sales.create",
  "module": "Sales",
  "branch_id": 2,
  "causer_id": 5,
  "description": "Created lead L-2025-001 - John Doe (walk_in)",
  "properties": {
    "lead_id": "L-2025-001",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "source": "walk_in"
  }
}
```

## üîç Filtering Capabilities

**Non-Admin Users can filter by:**
- Search (description/action)
- Module (Sales, Branch, Users, etc.)
- Status (success, failed, flagged)
- *(Branch is automatically their branch)*

**Admin Users can filter by:**
- Branch (All or specific branch)
- Search (description/action)
- Module (Sales, Branch, Users, etc.)
- Status (success, failed, flagged)

## üìà Statistics Are Branch-Aware

All statistics automatically respect branch filtering:
- **Total Events Today**: Count of logs in selected branch
- **Active Users**: Users who performed actions in that branch
- **Failed Actions**: Failed actions in that branch
- **Flagged Events**: Flagged events in that branch (last 7 days)

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Branches can't see each other's activities
2. **Admin Oversight**: Admins can monitor all branches or focus on one
3. **Automatic**: No manual branch_id passing required
4. **Auditable**: Complete trail of which branch each action belongs to
5. **Scalable**: Indexed for performance even with millions of logs
6. **Secure**: Enforced at database query level

## üöÄ Ready to Use

The system is now fully operational with branch filtering! 

- ‚úÖ All existing activity logs will continue to work
- ‚úÖ New logs automatically capture branch_id
- ‚úÖ Non-admin users see only their branch
- ‚úÖ Admin users have full visibility with filtering options
