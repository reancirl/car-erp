# Performance Metrics - Dynamic Data Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Performance Metrics page to use **real, dynamic data** from the database instead of mock data. All metrics are now calculated from actual system data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Controller
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/PerformanceMetricsController.php`

**Calculated Metrics:**
- **Lead Conversion Rate**: (Qualified Leads / Total Leads) × 100
- **Active Pipelines Count**: Pipelines not in 'won' or 'lost' stage
- **Test Drive Completion Rate**: (Completed Test Drives / Total Test Drives) × 100
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Average rating from completed surveys
- **Average Pipeline Duration**: Average days from creation to close (won/lost)
- **Pipeline Win Rate**: (Won Pipelines / Closed Pipelines) × 100

**Summary Cards:**
- **Total Leads**: Count of leads created in the period
- **Test Drives Completed**: Count of completed test drives
- **Active Pipelines**: Count of currently active pipelines

**Sales Rep Performance:**
- Leads assigned and converted
- Conversion rate
- Pipelines managed and won
- Active pipeline value
- Test drives conducted
- Customer satisfaction rating
- Ranked by conversion rate

### 2. Frontend Updates
**File:** `resources/js/pages/sales/performance-metrics.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Replaced all mock data with props from backend
- Updated summary cards to show measurable data:
  - ~~Total Revenue~~ → **Total Leads**
  - ~~Units Sold~~ → **Test Drives Completed**
  - ~~Active Pipeline (revenue)~~ → **Active Pipelines (count)**
- Updated sales rep performance table to show pipelines won/managed instead of revenue
- Updated system event sources to show real counts

### 3. Route Update
**File:** `routes/web.php`

Changed from inline function to controller:
```php
Route::get('/performance-metrics', [\App\Http\Controllers\PerformanceMetricsController::class, 'index'])
```

## Data Sources

### Metrics Calculated From:
1. **Leads Table**: Total leads, qualified leads, conversion rates
2. **Pipelines Table**: Active pipelines, win rates, duration, quote amounts
3. **Test Drives Table**: Total test drives, completion rates
4. **Customer Surveys Table**: Satisfaction ratings
5. **Users Table**: Sales rep assignments and performance

### Branch Filtering
- **Admin/Auditor**: See all branches
- **Other Users**: See only their assigned branch
- Respects existing branch scoping patterns

### Date Range Filtering
- **Default**: Current month (start to end)
- **Customizable**: Via `start_date` and `end_date` parameters
- **Comparison**: Automatically calculates previous period for trend analysis

## Key Features

### Auto-Calculated Metrics
- All metrics calculated in real-time from database
- No manual overrides allowed
- Complete audit trail via activity logs
- Trend comparison with previous period

### Performance Tracking
- Lead conversion rates
- Pipeline progression and win rates
- Test drive effectiveness
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Sales cycle duration

### Sales Rep Rankings
- Ranked by conversion rate
- Individual performance metrics
- Pipeline value tracking
- Customer satisfaction per rep

]
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Date Range Picker**: Add functional date range selector in UI
2. **Branch Filter**: Add branch dropdown for admin users
3. **Export Functionality**: Export metrics to PDF/Excel
4. **Charts/Graphs**: Visual representation of trends
5. **Goal Setting**: Allow setting custom targets per metric
6. **Alerts**: Notifications when metrics fall below targets
7. **Historical Comparison**: Compare multiple periods side-by-side

### Additional Metrics:
- Average response time to leads
- Quote-to-close ratio
- Customer retention rate
- Referral conversion rate
- Average deal size
- Revenue per sales rep

## Standards Compliance

✅ **Branch Scoping**: Respects user branch assignments
✅ **Permissions**: Uses `reports.view` permission
✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces
✅ **Real Data**: All metrics from actual database records
✅ **Trend Analysis**: Comparison with previous period
✅ **Auto-Calculation**: No manual data entry
✅ **Activity Logging**: Inherits from existing activity log system

## Testing

### To Test:
1. Create some leads with different statuses
2. Create pipelines in various stages
3. Schedule and complete test drives
4. Generate customer surveys
5. Visit `/sales/performance-metrics` to see real data

### Expected Behavior:
- Summary cards show actual counts
- KPI table shows calculated percentages
- Sales rep performance shows individual stats
- Trends compare with previous period
- All data respects branch filtering

## Files Modified/Created
