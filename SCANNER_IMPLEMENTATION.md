# Parts Inventory Scanner Implementation

**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready to Test
**Route:** `/inventory/parts-inventory/scanner`
**Permissions:** `inventory.view` (scan & view), `inventory.edit` (stock/location updates)

---

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive barcode/QR code scanner for the parts inventory system that works seamlessly on both desktop (with hardware scanners) and mobile devices (with camera scanning).

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dual-Mode Scanning Support

#### Desktop Mode (Hardware Scanner)
- Large input field that accepts hardware scanner input
- Hardware barcode/QR scanners work like keyboards - they scan and press Enter
- Auto-submit on Enter key press
- Manual entry fallback
- Focus maintained on input field for rapid sequential scanning

#### Mobile Mode (Camera Scanning)
- Camera button to activate mobile device camera
- Uses `html5-qrcode` library for reliable QR/barcode detection
- Rear camera preferred automatically
- Visual feedback with scanning box overlay
- Stop camera button while scanning

### 2. Quick Lookup
- Searches by: barcode, SKU, or part number
- Branch-filtered results (users see only their branch, admin sees all)
- Real-time feedback (loading states, success/error messages)
- Audio beep on successful scan

### 3. Part Details Display
After successful scan, displays:
- Part name, part number, manufacturer
- Status badge (active/inactive/discontinued)
- Stock badge (in stock/low stock/out of stock)
- **Stock Levels Grid:**
  - On Hand quantity
  - Reserved quantity
  - Available quantity (calculated)
- **Location Information** (if set):
  - Warehouse / Aisle / Rack / Bin
- **Pricing:**
  - Unit cost
  - Selling price

### 4. Quick Actions

#### Stock Adjustment
- Quick buttons: -10, -1, +1, +10
- Custom input field for any quantity
- Prevents negative stock (validation)
- Updates part immediately
- Activity logged with "(Scanner)" tag
- Audio feedback on success

#### Location Update
- Update warehouse, aisle, rack, bin fields
- Pre-filled with current location as placeholder
- Updates only fields that are changed
- Activity logged with "(Scanner)" tag
- Audio feedback on success

#### View Full Details
- Link to full part view page
- Access to complete part information

### 5. Scan History
- Shows last 10 scanned parts
- Click any history item to re-scan
- Displays part name, code, and timestamp
- Persists during session (resets on page reload)

---

## Backend Implementation

### New Controller Methods

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/PartInventoryController.php`

#### 1. `scanner()` - Show Scanner Page
```php
GET /inventory/parts-inventory/scanner
```
Renders the scanner interface.

#### 2. `scan()` - Lookup Part
```php
POST /inventory/parts-inventory/scan
Body: { "code": "barcode-value" }
```
- Searches by barcode, SKU, or part_number
- Returns JSON with part data or 404 error
- Branch filtering applied

#### 3. `quickUpdate()` - Quick Updates
```php
POST /inventory/parts-inventory/{id}/quick-update
Body: {
  "action": "adjust_stock|update_location",
  "quantity_change": 5,  // for adjust_stock
  "warehouse_location": "Main",  // for update_location
  "aisle": "A",
  "rack": "R1",
  "bin": "B1"
}
```
- Handles both stock adjustments and location updates
- Validates negative stock prevention
- Logs activity with changes
- Returns updated part data

### Routes Added

**File:** `routes/web.php`

```php
// Scanner page
GET  /inventory/parts-inventory/scanner
     -> PartInventoryController::scanner()
     -> Middleware: inventory.view

// Scan lookup
POST /inventory/parts-inventory/scan
     -> PartInventoryController::scan()
     -> Middleware: inventory.view

// Quick update
POST /inventory/parts-inventory/{partsInventory}/quick-update
     -> PartInventoryController::quickUpdate()
     -> Middleware: inventory.edit
```

## Frontend Implementation

### Scanner Page Component

**File:** `resources/js/pages/inventory/parts-inventory-scanner.tsx`

**Key Features:**
- React hooks for state management
- `html5-qrcode` integration for camera scanning
- Real-time scan processing
- Form submissions via Fetch API (not Inertia, for better control)
- Audio feedback using Web Audio API
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Error handling and loading states
- CSRF token handling for security

**State Management:**
- Code input value
- Scanning status
- Loading states
- Current part data
- Scan history (array)
- Stock adjustment panel toggle
- Location update panel toggle
- Error and success messages
- Camera state

### Navigation Update

**File:** `resources/js/components/app-sidebar.tsx`

Added "Scanner" link to Inventory Management section:
- Icon: Scan (lucide-react)
- Position: Between "Parts & Accessories" and "Vehicle Models"
- Route: `/inventory/parts-inventory/scanner`

---

## User Interface Design

### Mobile-Optimized Layout
- Full-width cards on mobile, max-width container on desktop
- Large touch targets for buttons
- Camera scanner takes full card width
- Stacked action buttons on mobile, grid on desktop
- Responsive font sizes

### Color Coding
- **Green badges:** In stock, active status
- **Yellow badges:** Low stock
- **Red badges:** Out of stock, errors
- **Blue highlights:** Location information
- **Gray:** Secondary information

### Interactive Elements
- Input field auto-focuses on page load
- Enter key submits search
- Quick quantity buttons (-10, -1, +1, +10)
- Collapsible action panels (stock adjust, location update)
- Click scan history items to re-scan

---

## Security & Authorization

### Branch Filtering
- Non-admin users see only their branch parts
- Admin/auditor users see all branches
- Enforced in both scan and update operations

### Permissions Required
- `inventory.view` - Access scanner, search parts
- `inventory.edit` - Stock adjustments, location updates

### CSRF Protection
- All POST requests include CSRF token from meta tag
- Laravel validates token server-side

### Input Validation
- Backend validates all inputs
- Prevents negative stock
- String length limits on location fields
- Required field validation

---

## Activity Logging

All operations are logged to activity logs:

### Stock Adjustment
```
Module: Parts Inventory
Action: update
Description: "Adjusted stock for [Part Name]: +5 (Scanner)"
Properties: {
  changes: {
    quantity_on_hand: { old: 10, new: 15 }
  }
}
```

### Location Update
```
Module: Parts Inventory
Action: update
Description: "Updated location for [Part Name] (Scanner)"
Properties: {
  changes: {
    warehouse_location: { old: "Main", new: "Warehouse A" },
    aisle: { old: "A", new: "B" }
  }
}
```

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Scan history clears on page reload (not persisted)
2. No offline support (requires internet connection)
3. No batch scanning (one at a time)
4. Camera quality affects scan reliability

### Potential Future Enhancements
1. **Batch Operations:**
   - Scan multiple parts for bulk receiving
   - Export scan session to CSV

2. **Advanced Features:**
   - Generate and print part labels with QR codes
   - Integrate with purchase orders for receiving
   - Inventory count mode (scan to verify stock)
   - Low stock alert notifications

3. **Performance:**
   - Local storage for scan history persistence
   - Service worker for offline queueing
   - Faster camera detection algorithms

4. **Integration:**
   - Link to work orders (scan parts for job)
   - Link to sales (scan parts to add to invoice)
   - Link to transfers (scan for inter-branch transfers)

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
**Problem:** Camera won't start on mobile
**Solutions:**
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for camera API)
- Check browser permissions for camera
- Try refreshing the page
- Use manual entry as fallback

### Hardware Scanner Not Working
**Problem:** Scanner doesn't input to search box
**Solutions:**
- Ensure scanner is configured for "keyboard mode"
- Check USB connection
- Test scanner in notepad first
- Some scanners need suffix configured (usually Enter key)

### Part Not Found
**Problem:** Scanner beeps but shows "Part not found"
**Solutions:**
- Verify barcode is registered in system
- Check if viewing correct branch (admins)
- Try manual entry of code to verify
- Check barcode format (might need SKU instead)

### Permission Denied
**Problem:** Can't adjust stock or location
**Solutions:**
- User needs `inventory.edit` permission
- Contact admin to grant permission
- Can still view parts with `inventory.view`

5. **Input Validation:** Laravel form requests
6. **Activity Logging:** Full audit trail
